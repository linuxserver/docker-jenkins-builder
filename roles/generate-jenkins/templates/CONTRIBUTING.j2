## Common files

| File | Use case |
| :----: | --- |
| `Dockerfile` | Dockerfile used to build amd64 images |
| `Dockerfile.aarch64` | Dockerfile used to build 64bit ARM architectures |
| `Dockerfile.armhf` | Dockerfile used to build 32bit ARM architectures |
| `Jenkinsfile` | This file is a product of our builder and should not be edited directly. This is used to build the image |
| `jenkins-vars.yml` | This file is used to generate the `Jenkinsfile` mentioned above, it only affects the build-process |
| `package_versions.txt` | This file is generated as a part of the build-process, it lists all the installed packages and its version |
| `README.md` | This file is a product of our builder and should not be edited directly. This displays the readme for the repository and image registries |
| `readme-vars.yml` | This file is used to generate the `README.md` |

## Readme

If you would like to change our readme, please __**do not**__ directly edit the readme, as it is generated on each commit.
Instead edit the [readme-vars.yml]({{ project_lsio_github_repo_url }}/edit/master/jenkins-vars.yml).

These variables are used in a template for our [Jenkins Builder]({{ lsio_github_url }}/docker-jenkins-builder) as part of a ansible play.
Most of these variables is also carried over to [docs.linuxserver.io]({{ "https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/" + github_project_name if full_custom_readme is not defined else "https://docs.linuxserver.io" }})

### Fixing typos or clarify the text in the readme

There are variables for multiple parts of the readme, the most common ones are:

| Variable | Description |
| :----: | --- |
| `project_blurb` | This is the short excerpt shown above the project logo. |
| `app_setup_block` | This is the text that shows up under "Application Setup" if enabled |

### Parameters

The compose and run examples are also generated from these variables.

We have a [reference file]({{ lsio_github_url }}/docker-jenkins-builder/blob/master/vars/_container-vars-blank) in our Jenkins Builder.

These are prefixed with `param_` for required parameters, or `opt_param` for optional parameters, except for `cap_add`.
Remember to enable param, if currently disabled. This differ between parameters, and can be seen in the reference file.

Devices, environment variables, ports and volumes expects its variables in a certain way.

### Devices

```yml
param_devices:
  - { device_path: "/dev/dri", device_host_path: "/dev/dri", desc: "For hardware transcoding" }
opt_param_devices:
  - { device_path: "/dev/dri", device_host_path: "/dev/dri", desc: "For hardware transcoding" }
```

#### Environment variables

```yml
param_env_vars:
  - { env_var: "TZ", env_value: "Europe/London", desc: "Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London." }
opt_param_env_vars:
  - { env_var: "VERSION", env_value: "latest", desc: "Supported values are LATEST, PLEXPASS or a specific version number." }
```

#### Ports

```yml
param_ports:
  - { external_port: "80", internal_port: "80", port_desc: "Application WebUI" }
opt_param_ports:
  - { external_port: "80", internal_port: "80", port_desc: "Application WebUI" }
```

#### Volumes

```yml
param_volumes:
  - { vol_path: "/config", vol_host_path: "</path/to/appdata/config>", desc: "Configuration files." }
opt_param_volumes:
  - { vol_path: "/config", vol_host_path: "</path/to/appdata/config>", desc: "Configuration files." }
```

## Dockerfiles

We use multiple Dockerfiles in our repos, this is because sometimes some CPU architectures needs different packages to work.
If you are proposing additional packages to be added, ensure that you added the packages to all the Dockerfiles.

### Testing your changes

```
git clone {{ lsio_github_url }}/{{ github_project_name }}.git
cd {{ github_project_name }}
docker build \
  --no-cache \
  --pull \
  -t {{ lsio_project_name_short }}/{{ project_name }}:latest .
```

The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware using `multiarch/qemu-user-static`
```
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```

Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with `-f Dockerfile.aarch64`.

## Update the chagelog

If you are modifying the Dockerfiles or any of the startup scripts in [root]({{project_lsio_github_repo_url}}/tree/master/root), add an entry to the changelog

```yml
changelogs:
  - { date: "DD.MM.YY:", desc: "Added some love to templates" }
```
